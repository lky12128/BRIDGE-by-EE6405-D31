## Overview
This project focuses on developing a model capable of performing Question-Answering (QA) tasks across multi-category product reviews, encapsulating the model as an API to enable rapid Q&A through a ChatBot UI. **B**ERT-based **R**eview **I**ntegration with **D**ual **G**enerative **E**vidence (BRIDGE), as the core component of the project, excels in multi-turn, context-aware question answering. It builds upon BERT as a language encoder, incorporating a hierarchical memory layer to preserve contextual representations, and is equipped with a decoder that generates answers based on the question and contextual memory.
